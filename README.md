# Assignment #4: Linear Regression on Men 100m World Record

This paper applies linear regression (LR) from the SkLearn library to investigate the relationship between the men's 100m world record (WR) time and its respective year. Before training the model, we analyze the correlation between variables. The most correlated variables are between the WR time and WR year, with a -0.91 correlation. Therefore, our LR model will be fitted with these two variables.
